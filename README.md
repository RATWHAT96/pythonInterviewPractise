# Interview Practise Application
A simple program to help practice two types of interview questions; motivational and competency questions. 
This involves a GUI that includes two buttons; one to present a new motivational question and one to present a new competency question. 
The GUI also includes a timer that resets to 120 seconds every-time either button is clicked. 
The GUI was created using Tkinter.
